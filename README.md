Real-Time Disaster Detection System
Overview
   A machine learning-based system that detects natural disasters in real-time, such as floods and fires, using satellite images and social media data. The project provides instant alerts and visualizes disaster locations on a dynamic map.

Features
   Real-time disaster detection
   Classification of disasters (floods, fires, etc.)
   Instant alerts and notifications
   Disaster visualization on an interactive map
   Built using Python for the backend and Next.js for the frontend
   Tech Stack
      Frontend: Next.js, React.js
      Backend: Python, Flask/FastAPI
      Machine Learning: TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV (for image processing)
      Database: MongoDB/MySQL (for storing data)
      Cloud: AWS/Google Cloud for deployment
      APIs: Integration with satellite image providers (e.g., NASA), and social media data (Twitter API)
Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-time-disaster-detection.git
cd real-time-disaster-detection
2. Install Backend Dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Install Frontend Dependencies:
   cd frontend
   npm install
4. Run the Application:
Backend:
   python app.py
Frontend:
   npm run dev
How It Works
   The machine learning model processes satellite images or social media data to detect disasters.
   The system sends real-time alerts when a disaster is identified.
   The frontend visualizes the disaster on a map with relevant details.
